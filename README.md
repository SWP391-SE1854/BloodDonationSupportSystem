# Blood Donation Management System

A frontend application for a blood donation management system, built with React and TypeScript.

## Project Overview

This system provides a user interface for a comprehensive blood donation management platform. It includes pages and components for three main user roles:

*   **Donors**: Can register, manage their profile, and view donation history.
*   **Staff**: Can manage blood requests, inventory, and donor records.
*   **Administrators**: Have access to a dashboard for user management and system monitoring.

_Note: This is a frontend-only application. It requires a separate backend service to function fully._

## Tech Stack

*   React 18 with TypeScript
*   Vite for build tooling
*   Tailwind CSS for styling
*   Shadcn/ui for UI components
*   React Query for data fetching
*   React Router for navigation
*   Axios for API communication

## Connecting to a Backend

This frontend is designed to work with a backend API. The API service calls are defined in `src/services/api.ts`. You will need to configure the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your environment to point to your backend server.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://your-backend-api-url.com/api
```
